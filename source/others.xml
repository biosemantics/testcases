  Pappi usually ± equaling corollas , sometimes coroniform or 0. 2n = ( 22–) 34 (–54) univalents , less often 17 pairs;
  Pappi of 2–3 awns plus shorter bristles or scales, or wholly of minute scales.
  Roots usually taproots, sometime fibrous.
  Heads radiate, borne singly or in 2s or 3s, or in tight to loose, corymbiform arrays;
  Phyllaries green or often purple, with appressed, green or tan, coarse setae, sometimes reduced to a single seta per phyllary;
  Ray corollas yellow to orange-yellow or occasionally suffused with red;
  Corollas yellow, laminae 6-15 mm;
  Arrays not leafy, narrowly to broadly secund pyramidal or club-shaped, much longer than broad;
  Subtending bracts ovate, usually large, leaflike, well differentiated;
  Ray laminae yellow, usually each with a proximal, red-brown to purple spot or band, 15-20+ mm;
  Stems ascending to erect, branched from at or near bases;
  Blades pinnately veined or ± 3-nerved from at or near bases, deltate-ovate, lance-elliptic, lanceolate, lance-ovate, or ovate, margins serrate, abaxial faces usually gland-dotted and hirsute, puberulent, pubescent, scabrous, or stipitate-glandular, sometimes glabrate, adaxial faces mostly puberulent to scabrous-hirsute and glabrescent, sometimes glabrate or glabrous;
  Pappi of 1–4 scales in 1 series, or of, 5–8 scales in 2, abruptly unequal series, longest scales, 1–, 2–8 mm. 2n = 12;
