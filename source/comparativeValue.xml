  <description type="morphology">
    Rachis widths mostly 2-3 times lobe widths, leaves green;
    Margins 1-2 times divided into linear or oblong segments;
    Petioles reduced distally 0-1/4 lengths of blades;
    Branches 0-10+, usually arising in distal 1/2, ascending, usually reaching a moreorless common height;
    Outer pectinately spiny 1/2 their length with many lateral spines;
	Leaves, 2-3 times ternately lobed or dissected;
	Peduncle lengths 0.5-3 times cypsela bodies at flowering;
	Corolla lobes 2 times as-long-as corolla throat;
	Leaves usually 0-5 times longer than wide;
	Leaf lengths usually 10+ times longer widths;
	Lengths, 1/2-2 times bodies; 
	Blades usually 1-2+ times pinnately lobed; 
	Peduncle lengths 2-5 times leafy portions of stems;
	Lengths of proximal branches 2 times array heights; 
	Tubes 2 times longer than narrowly funnelform throats;
	Tubes 1/4-1/2 times more or less funnelform throats;
	Lengths mostly 3.5-6 times longest diams;
	Arrays 2-3 times as-long-as wide; 
	Blades of cauline leaves mostly oblanceolate, lengths 4–7+ times widths;
	Leaf-blades oblong or elliptic to lance-elliptic or lanceolate, lengths 1.5–4+ widths;
	Cypsela widths 0.6 – 0.75 times lengths;
	Cypsela beaks, 3–, 4–10 mm, lengths, 1/2–, 2 times bodies;
	Capitular leaves mostly not appressed to heads, spatulate to obovate, lengths mostly 2-5 widths;
	Heads radiate, borne singly or in 2s or 3s, or in tight to loose, corymbiform arrays;
