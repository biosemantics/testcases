  <description type="morphology">
   Proximal leaves larger than distal leaves.
   Basal and proximal cauline 1_nerved , narrowly oblanceolate , (50–) 90–150×(2–) 4–9 (–12) mm wide;
   Basal and proximal cauline leaves red;
   Outer scales 20-25, 0.5-1 mm, contrasting with 35-40+, 4.5-6+ mm inner bristles.
   Leaves opposite, or proximal opposite and distal alternate.
   Pappi of 2–3 awns plus shorter bristles or scales, or wholly of minute scales.
   Tips of outer and mid phyllaries acute;
   Mid-stems (30-100+);
   Cypselae flattened, 2–(3–4)-nerved; pappi of outer, shorter bristles or scales plus inner, longer bristles; apices of inner erect , abaxial faces gray-tomentose , ± twisted .
   Phyllaries in 5–7 series, weakly unequal, dark green to brownish, lanceolate (outer) to linear (inner), abaxial faces without (or with very obscure) glutinous ridge; outer and middle appressed or apices spreading, at least outer irregularly spiny-fringed, finely serrulate, spines slender, 3–5 mm; apices of inner erect, abaxial faces gray-tomentose, ± twisted.
   Pistillate heads : phyllaries 12–30 (–80+) in 1–8+ series , outer , (1–)5–8 distinct or ± connate, the rest ± connate
   Pappi usually of 2 series, outer of readily falling, short bristles, inner persistent or falling as unit, of basally connate, usually longer, plumose bristles .
   Outer phyllaries appressed.
   Middle phyllaries appressed.
   Inner phyllaries lanceolate.
   Outer pappi 20-30;
   Inner pappi 10-50;
