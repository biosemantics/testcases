  Blades lanceolate to oblong , (8-)10-15(-18)×(2-)3-5(-9) cm overall;
  Leaves obovate, ( 2 – ) 5 – 20 ( – 30 + ) × ( 1 – ) 2 – 5 ( – 7 ) cm , margins pinnati_sect;
  Pappi usually ± equaling corollas , sometimes coroniform or 0 . 2n = ( 22 – ) 34 ( – 54 ) univalents , less often 17 pairs;
  Basal and proximal cauline leaves red;
  Outer scales 20-25, 0.5-1 mm, contrasting with 35-40+, 4.5-6+ mm inner bristles.
  Leaves opposite, or proximal opposite and distal alternate.
  Pappi of 2–3 awns plus shorter bristles or scales, or wholly of minute scales.
  Roots usually taproots, sometime fibrous.
  Tips of outer and mid phyllaries acute;
	 
   Subulate leaves inserted at 62°.
   
   mid-stems (30-100+);
   
   Rachis widths mostly 2-3 times lobe widths, leaves green;

   Cypselae flattened, 2–(3–4)-nerved; pappi of outer, shorter bristles or scales plus inner, longer bristles; apices of inner erect , abaxial faces gray-tomentose , ± twisted .
   
   Phyllaries in 5–7 series, weakly unequal, dark green to brownish, lanceolate (outer) to linear (inner), abaxial faces without (or with very obscure) glutinous ridge; outer and middle appressed or apices spreading, at least outer irregularly spiny-fringed, finely serrulate, spines slender, 3–5 mm; apices of inner erect, abaxial faces gray-tomentose, ± twisted.

     
   Pappi usually of 2 series , outer of readily falling , short bristles , inner persistent or falling as unit , of basally connate , usually longer , plumose bristles .


	
   Margins 1-2 times divided into linear or oblong segments;
	
	petioles reduced distally 0-1/4 lengths of blades;
	branches 0-10+, usually arising in distal 1/2, ascending, usually reaching a moreorless common height;
	outer pectinately spiny 1/2 their length with many lateral spines;
	

	

	peduncle lengths 0.5-3 times cypsela bodies at flowering;
	corolla lobes 2 times as-long-as corolla throat;
	leaves usually 0-5 times longer than wide;
	leaf lengths usually 10+ times longer widths;

	blades usually 1-2+ times pinnately lobed; 
	peduncle lengths 2-5 times leafy portions of stems;
	lengths of proximal branches 2 times array heights; 
	tubes 2 times longer than narrowly funnelform throats;
	tubes 1/4-1/2 times more or less funnelform throats;
	lengths mostly 3.5-6 times longest diams;
	arrays 2-3 times as-long-as wide; 
	blades of cauline leaves mostly oblanceolate, lengths 4–7+ times widths;
	leaf-blades oblong or elliptic to lance-elliptic or lanceolate, lengths 1.5–4+ widths;
	cypsela widths 0.6 – 0.75 times lengths;
	cypsela beaks, 3–, 4–10 mm, lengths, 1/2–, 2 times bodies;
	capitular leaves mostly not appressed to heads, spatulate to obovate, lengths mostly 2-5 widths;


	
	heads radiate, borne singly or in 2s or 3s, or in tight to loose, corymbiform arrays;
		
	phyllaries green or often purple, with appressed, green or tan, coarse setae, sometimes reduced to a single seta per phyllary;
	ray corollas yellow to orange-yellow or occasionally suffused with red;
	corollas yellow, laminae 6-15 mm;
	arrays not leafy, narrowly to broadly secund pyramidal or club-shaped, much longer than broad;
	subtending bracts ovate, usually large, leaflike, well differentiated;
	ray laminae yellow, usually each with a proximal, red-brown to purple spot or band, 15-20+ mm;
	stems ascending to erect, branched from at or near bases;
	blades pinnately veined or ± 3-nerved from at or near bases, deltate-ovate, lance-elliptic, lanceolate, lance-ovate, or ovate, margins serrate, abaxial faces usually gland-dotted and hirsute, puberulent, pubescent, scabrous, or stipitate-glandular, sometimes glabrate, adaxial faces mostly puberulent to scabrous-hirsute and glabrescent, sometimes glabrate or glabrous;
	pappi of 1–4 scales in 1 series, or of, 5–8 scales in 2, abruptly unequal series, longest scales, 1–, 2–8 mm. 2n = 12;
