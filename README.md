=========
TestCases repository is used to build a test case repository for CharaParser.
Older test cases has number-based file names, and the more recent cases are named by the features they are testing.
Older test cases are not in the xml format required by ETC, and the more recent cases are, and the latter files also contain charaparser and glossary versions used.
All test cases assumes the terms presented in ETC Text Capture:Term Review step are categorized.

New versions of CharaParser should evaluated against test cases in the current format.
